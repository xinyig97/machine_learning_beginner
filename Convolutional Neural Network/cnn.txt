- detect content in image
- looking for vertical line / horizontal line / edges / ... 


- each layer / hidden layer  consists of ( convolution + pool )
- fully connected layer 
- output layer -> fully connected layer 

- input data -> convolution(feature maps) -> pool -> fully connected layer -> output 
    - when doing convolution, actually generates featuremaps 
    - after the featuremaps, we do pooling on the featuremaps   
        - pooling can be any type of evaluation on the featuremaps, 
        - ie. find the max / min /average / mean /...
    - convolution + pool => hidden layer
