- word - numeric 
- lexcon 
- each word has an id 
- hot, not have to be one hot 


- global lexicon : 
[chair,table,spoon,television]
    - when come a new string : 
        "I pulled the chair up to the table"
        - np.zeros(len(lexicon)) -> [1 1 0 0] -> walk through the string and check each word if that exists in the lexicon or not,
            if it does, set the corresponding index to 1, otherwise left 0


- some limitations / constraints that need to be considered : 
    - data too big, can't fit in the memory :
        - using buffer and running batch by batch through streaming 
    - training takes too long 
        - use gpu / parallel programming -> ece 408 came in !!
        - tpu : tensor processing unit 

- save the model if the accuracy is high enough
