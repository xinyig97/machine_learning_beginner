deep learning with neural networks and tensorflow introduction 


- biological neuron:
    - anotomy of a neuron :
        - denarites - neuron - axon - axon terminal - synapse - 

    some inputs come through the denarites of one neuron and pass along to the neuron, something happened to those inputs in the neuron and generate 
    an output from the neuron and got passed along to the axon then axon terminal, depending on some thershold, it might pass through the synapse or not.
    if it does, the processed generated output got passed to the next neuron as the input through denarites

- artifical neuron:
    - similar to the biological neuron
    - anatomy of a neuron: 
        - inputs - weights on each inputs - processing function - step functions (threshold function) - output - 
        - output would be 1 or 0 
        - step function is not technical irl, since either a 1 or 0 does not help that much 
            - people use sigmod fuction to scale the output, thus instead of calling it a threshold function, it;s called activation function
    if it overcome the threshold, the output would be an 1 and got passed along to the next neuron. otherwise it got outputed as a 0 

 
 regular neural network : has one hidden layer 
 deep neural networl: has 2 or more hidden layers 


neural network is one type of machine learning model and so far, it's the best machine learning model 
- need a huge amount of input samples 
- we dont know how the modeling it does in neural network 
- neural network generates its own model (logical model instead of only classfication )


where to get the huge amount of data:
- imagenet 
- ltk 
- wikipediea dump
- chat log 
- crawl reddit 
- machinelearning sub-reddit
