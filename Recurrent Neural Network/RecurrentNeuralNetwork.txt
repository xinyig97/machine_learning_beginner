more than the traditional dnn 
- order of events happening cant be sensed by tradition deep neural network
- catch a ball, order of frames decided the travel direction
- more used with natural language data
- with traditional neural network: feed forward, back propogation 
- but we want to take the order of events happening into consideration 

recurrent neural network :
- sequential and temporary events where order matters


- recurrent neural network explaination :
    - x1 - a - o1
    - x2 - (o1)-a-o2
    - x3 - (o2) - a - o3 
    - x4 - (o3) a - o4 
    previous ouput chained to next input

- long short term memory cell: 
    - x - {
        recurrent,  
        forget gate / keep gate,  -> for recurrent element, what should we keep or leave 
        add what?, -> for new input 
        output what? 
    } - o
