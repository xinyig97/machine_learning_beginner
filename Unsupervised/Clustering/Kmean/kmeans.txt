- k is the number of groups that you want the machine to classify 
- flat 


- take entire dataset, choose k centeriods(center of clusters)
- calculate the distance of other nodes to those k centeroids and based on distance, classify the classes
- totally randomly chosen
- then find the center of each groups as new centeroids
- keep repeating the process till centeroids does not change 


parameters:
- tolerance 
- max_iteration


downside: 
- want to group in relative same sizes 
	- mouse data set 
- scaling 

from unsupervised, after finding the classifier, use it as supervised
