hierarchical clustering 
machine decides how many clustering it would have 

- all featureset is a cluster center / centroid itself 

- radius / bandwidth 
    - a radius around every data point 
    - find all data points within that bandwidth and take the average position of all data points to calculate for a new centroid
    - does this for all shifted centroid for each node 
    - utill no change in the centroid, get optimized 
    - can have different level of bandwidth 

- convergence -> when all shifted centeroids come to one point 
- divergence ->
