- 2D regression best fit line :(y_hat line)

y = mx+b 
m -> slope 
b -> y-intercept 

- to calculate m:
m =((mean(x)*mean(y))-mean(x*y))/((mean(x))^2 - mean(x^2))


- to calculate b:
b = mean(y)-m*mean(x)



- accuracy of the best_fit_line -> how good is the line 
" square error  "
e = distance between data and the line 
we use e^2 
r^2 = 1 - se(best_fit(y))/se(mean(y)) 
-  mean(y) - > just a straight line
the higher r^2, the more accurate
